This is the best performing version of CPUben.

It was compiled with G++.

To test multi-threaded performance, go into the "multi" folder and select
multiple copies of CPUben and run them simultaneously, observing the performance
decrease as more copies are added.  

CPUben is tuned so that a Ryzen 7 1700 CPU at stock clock speed will produce
a single threaded result of around 100,000.  You can compare your performance that way.
